            <div class="content">
                 <p>TBD is a non-profit organization that provides highschoolers from around the world with specific projects from different industries and fields. The projects often involve students proposing a solution to a real-life problem, or improvise on existing solutions. </p>
            </div>
        <button class="collapsible">What is the cost for participation?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Every process is completely free, from filling out an application form to submitting the final project.</p>
            </div>
        <button class="collapsible">What are some benefits?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>There are many. As a non-profit organization, TBD can give students volunteering hours for your determination and effort. Money, in the form of scholarships will also be offered to students who display an exceptional work through their final submission of their work. Recognition will be given for all the students who participated. Last but certainly not the least, the experience and knowledge they get from successfully finishing their project will be significant.</p>
            </div>
        <button class="collapsible">What is the acceptance rate?</button>
            <div class="content">

        <button class="collapsible">How will this help with college?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>All the projects are there for high schoolers to either help them gain more knowledge, provide a valuable experience, or help them find their passion. Ultimately, the key factors are effort, dedication, and consistency. If all those factors are above standards, including these projects as part of activities and extracurriculars list will certainly help admission officers understand students better.</p>
